# Write your first lines of Java code right NOW, in less than 5 minutes.

## Lets do it in few simple steps:
### 1. First we need go to this website (we will use it as online development environment):

https://www.onlinegdb.com/

[or if that one doesn't work we go to this website: https://compiler.run/]

### 2. And then we need make sure Java is selected from the top drop down menu, where all the programing languages are.

### 3. After that we write the following code in there:
```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("My first lines of code!");
		System.out.println("Hello world!");
		System.out.println("It is so easy!");
	}
}
```
